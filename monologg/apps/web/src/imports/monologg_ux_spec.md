## 1. PRODUCT & AUDIENCE SUMMARY

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Product Name** | Monologg |
| **Product Type** | PWA (Progressive Web App) — Mobile-first; Desktop adaptive |
| **Industry** | Performing Arts / Creator Economy / Marketplace |
| **Core Problem** | Creators lose 20%+ income to intermediaries; clients waste weeks on static portfolio review with no instant scheduling or payment lock-in |
| **Solution** | Unified brief-to-booking pipeline: Verified talent profiles → AI analysis → Rate cards → Scheduling → Escrow payment → Order room |
| **Delivery Target** | Q3 2026 |

### Primary Users

| User Type | Who They Are | Tech Comfort | Core Goal |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Talent (Creator)** | Actors, Comedians, VO Artists, Comperes, Pastors, Musicians, Streamers | Mid–High | Build a bookable storefront, get discovered, receive payment |
| **Client (Employer)** | Casting leads, brand agencies, event coordinators, church admins | Mid | Find verified talent, post a brief, secure booking with payment |

### The Core 4 Talent Niches (Primary Launch)
1. Actors — monologue reels, film/TV audition bookings
2. Comedians — live sets, corporate bookings
3. Voice-Over Artists — voice demos, remote studio sessions
4. Comperes — hosting reels, live event emcee bookings

### Extended Creator Niches (Inclusive Architecture)
Pastors / Public Speakers, Musicians, Content Creators, Streamers

### UX Vocabulary Rule
- ❌ "Add Cast Role Title" → ✅ "Add Booking Service Title"
- ❌ "Upload Audition Tape" → ✅ "Upload Performance / Showcase Reel"
- All labels must be niche-agnostic unless the creator's specific niche is selected

## 3. NAVIGATION STRUCTURE

### 3.1 Recommendation: Bottom Navigation Bar (Mobile PWA)

**Why Bottom Nav over Top Nav or Sidebar:**
- Mobile-first PWA — thumb reach is critical; bottom nav is the industry standard for app-like experiences
- 4–5 destinations maximum keeps cognitive load low
- Matches user mental models from Instagram, TikTok, Fiverr apps that creators already use

### 3.2 Creator Bottom Nav (Post-Onboarding)

| Tab | Icon | Screen |
|---|---|---|
| Home | House | Creator Dashboard / Storefront Preview |
| Bookings | Calendar | Order Rooms / Active Projects |
| Discover | Search | Casting Directory (see who's hiring) |
| Inbox | Bell | Notification Centre |
| Profile | Person | Settings + Profile Management |

### 3.3 Client Bottom Nav (Post-Registration)

| Tab | Icon | Screen |
|---|---|---|
| Home | House | Client Dashboard |
| Find Talent | Search | Casting Directory Feed |
| Projects | Briefcase | Posted Briefs + Active Orders |
| Inbox | Bell | Notification Centre |
| Account | Person | Settings |

### 3.4 Desktop Top Navigation (Portal / Landing)

```
[MONOLOGG logo]    [Find Talent]  [Post a Project]  [How it Works]    [Sign In] [Launch Your Storefront →]
```

### 3.5 Onboarding Navigation
- No bottom nav during onboarding (linear flow)
- Progress indicator at top: stepped dots or percentage bar
- Back chevron top-left only; no skip unless explicitly noted

---

## 10. STRUCTURAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### 10.1 Navigation Pattern

**Recommendation: Bottom tab bar (mobile) + Top nav (desktop/marketing site)**

Justification: This is a mobile-first PWA targeting creators who live on their phones. Bottom navigation matches the mental models of the apps they already use daily (Instagram, WhatsApp, Fiverr). The 5-tab structure gives access to all key areas with one thumb tap. On desktop, a top nav is the standard expectation for a marketing/portal page and does not conflict.

---

### 10.2 Screens at Risk of Drop-Off

| Screen | Risk | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| **PWA-04 (Thespian AI)** | High — any delay over 30s causes anxiety and abandonment | Add real-time microcopy that changes every 10s; show skip at 60s; never show a raw spinner with no copy |
| **PWA-06 (Rate Cards)** | Medium — creators freeze on pricing decisions | Provide price range suggestions based on niche ("Actors in your region typically charge $80–$250 per session") |
| **PWA-12 (Payment)** | High — payment screens lose trust if they feel generic | FINCRA branding, SSL badge, escrow explanation all must be above the fold; do not hide behind scroll |
| **PWA-02 (Niche Grid)** | Low-medium — "Extended Creator" users may not see themselves | Ensure Streamer, Pastor, Content Creator tiles are visible without scrolling on 375px viewport |

---

### 10.3 Flows That Could Be Simplified or Merged

| Current | Issue | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| PWA-01a (Splash) → PWA-01b (Register) | Unnecessary hop if user intent is already clear | On direct link entry (e.g. "Launch Your Storefront" from WEB-03), skip splash and land directly on Register pre-set to "Talent" |
| PWA-11 (Calendar) is a separate screen from PWA-07 (Storefront) | Context shift between "viewing" and "booking" | Open calendar as a bottom sheet overlay on PWA-07 rather than full navigation; reduces back-stack depth |
| PWA-04 → PWA-05 feel like two separate screens for one event | Could cause a "loading then landing" jolt | Transition them as one continuous screen using animation: AI processing at top, results reveal at bottom when complete |

---

### 10.4 Progressive Disclosure Opportunities

| Screen | What to Disclose Progressively |
|---|---|
| **PWA-06 (Rate Cards)** | Show only one card form by default; reveal "+ Add another service" only after first card is complete |
| **PWA-09 (Brief Form)** | Show script upload and location preference only after Project Type is selected |
| **PWA-11 (Calendar)** | Show time slots only after a date is tapped; do not pre-expand all days |
| **PWA-12 (Payment)** | Show bank transfer option only after card tab is selected (avoid overwhelming with both forms at once) |
| **PWA-13 (Order Room)** | Collapse booking summary by default; expand on tap |
| **Settings screens** | Group advanced settings (payout, integrations) under a "More" disclosure toggle; surface name/bio/rate cards first |

---

### 10.5 Accessibility Considerations

| Screen | Consideration |
|---|---|
| **PWA-02 (Niche Grid)** | Each grid tile must have an accessible label, not just an icon. Focus state must be clearly visible. |
| **PWA-03 (Media Upload)** | Drag-and-drop must have a keyboard-accessible fallback (file browser button always visible) |
| **PWA-04 (AI Processing)** | Animated pulse must respect `prefers-reduced-motion`; provide text-only loading state as fallback |
| **PWA-07 (Storefront)** | Video reel player must support captions. Audio players must have a visible play/pause state accessible via keyboard. |
| **PWA-12 (Payment)** | All payment input fields must have explicit `<label>` associations; CVV field must explain what it is (not just a tooltip) |
| **PWA-13 (Order Room)** | Voice messages must show a duration indicator and be keyboard-playable. System messages should use `aria-live` regions. |
| **PWA-10 (Directory)** | Filter pills must be keyboard-navigable and show clear focus rings. Active filter count must be announced to screen readers. |
| **All CTAs** | Minimum tap target 44×44px. Disabled states must not rely on colour alone — use opacity + cursor change. |
| **Colour contrast** | All body text must meet WCAG AA (4.5:1). Verified badge and escrow progress bar colours must not convey state by colour alone (add icons/labels). |
| **Error states** | All inline errors must be associated to their input field via `aria-describedby`. Never place error copy below a fold. |

### 10.6 Onboarding Efficiency Target

The entire Creator onboarding flow (PWA-01 → PWA-07 live storefront) should be completable in under 5 minutes on a standard mobile connection, assuming:
- File upload: <150MB at 10Mbps ≈ 2 minutes max
- Thespian AI: 15–45 seconds
- Rate card creation: 1–2 minutes

Design implication: every field in the onboarding sequence should be essential. Nothing optional should be required. Optional fields (bio, secondary niche, description) should be clearly marked and skippable.
