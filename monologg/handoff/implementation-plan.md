# Monologg — Implementation Plan (Living Document)

**Last updated:** 2026-07-27
**Status:** Frontend prototype running locally. No backend/database/auth yet.

This is the single place to see, at a glance: what's done, what's actively in progress, and what's left. Update this file **in the same session** as any change that completes, starts, or adds a task — see `README.md` for the full update policy. Checkboxes are the source of truth; don't let this drift into just a historical record like `log.md` — that's what `log.md` is for.

## ✅ Done

### Phase 1 — Get the product running
- [x] Extract and identify real source code from the four Figma Make export zips
- [x] Assemble a runnable app (`index.html`, `src/main.tsx`, app-mode `vite.config.ts`) — original export was library-mode only
- [x] Install dependencies
- [x] Publish a one-off shareable static preview (Artifact)
- [x] Stand up a persistent local dev server at `http://localhost:5173` (`app/`, `npm run dev`)

### Phase 2 — Design system audit + remediation
- [x] Full audit: token usage consistency, duplicated components, radius/color/motion drift
- [x] Extract design tokens from an inline JS string (`Root.tsx`) into a real stylesheet, `src/styles/tokens.css`
- [x] Retire and delete two dead/conflicting CSS files (`theme.css`, `DoyinXMonologgCopy/styles.css`)
- [x] Centralize motion durations/eases (`src/lib/motionTokens.ts`)
- [x] Centralize modal scrim color (`--color-overlay` / `--color-overlay-strong`)
- [x] Fix untokenized radius classes in `TalentDashboard.tsx` (41) and `ClientDashboard.tsx` (16)
- [x] Fix `text-gray-*` bypasses of the text-color tokens
- [x] Build 6 shared components (`Modal`, `Avatar`, `Badge`, `FormField`, `Sidebar`, `BottomNav`) and wire them into every real call site
- [x] Build a live, self-updating `/design-system` documentation route
- [x] Build a standalone, shareable static build of the design-system page (`npm run build:designsystem`)

### Phase 3 — File cleanup
- [x] Remove dead/placeholder files from `app/` (confirmed with user first)
- [x] Remove original export zips + `.DS_Store` from the parent folder (confirmed with user first)
- [x] Verify build stayed byte-identical after each cleanup round

### Phase 4 — Handoff documentation
- [x] `design.md` — product, stack, and design-system reference
- [x] `log.md` — chronological implementation record
- [x] `bug.md` — defect log with severity
- [x] `process.md` — plain-language walkthrough
- [x] `README.md` + `implementation-plan.md` — living-document index and status board

### Phase 5 — Standalone builds + dependency cleanup
- [x] Diagnose why `index.html`/`design-system.html` didn't open outside the dev server (Vite source shells, not runnable files)
- [x] Add a hash-router build target (`AppStandalone.tsx`, `createHashRouter`, `vite.config.standalone.ts`) so the app works with no server
- [x] Build and inline both into single self-contained files: `monologg-app.html`, `monologg-design-system.html` (project root)
- [x] Audit all 26 dependencies against real usage; remove 20 unused packages + `vite-plugin-dts`; keep `vite` (confirmed with user — needed for localhost + rebuilds)
- [x] Fix the CSS-only `tw-animate-css` import the dependency-usage grep missed (see `bug.md` #5)
- [x] Verify all three build targets + dev server still work after cleanup; regenerate the two standalone HTML files

### Phase 6 — File structure reorganization
- [x] Survey entire tree; split findings into confirmed-dead vs. judgment calls
- [x] Delete confirmed-dead files (`.DS_Store`s, 4 orphaned parent-level config files with no `package.json` to run them)
- [x] Confirm with user before touching anything ambiguous (unused screenshots, old draft doc, renaming/README)
- [x] Rename `dev-preview/` → `app/`
- [x] Move unused logo PNGs into a labeled `brand/` folder
- [x] Move 18 unreferenced Figma screenshots into `app/src/imports/reference-screenshots/`
- [x] Move 3 superseded design/spec drafts into `app/src/imports/historical-drafts/`
- [x] Add a root-level `README.md` for wayfinding (technical + non-technical)
- [x] Update every `dev-preview` reference across `handoff/*.md` to `app`
- [x] Rebuild all three targets + smoke-test dev server to confirm the rename broke nothing; regenerate the two standalone HTML files

### Phase 7 — Dark-mode toggle fix (standalone design-system page)
- [x] Diagnose why the toggle silently did nothing (no `ThemeContext.Provider` in the standalone entry's render tree)
- [x] Extract theme state/persistence into a shared `useThemeState()` hook (`Root.tsx`)
- [x] Add a `StandaloneThemeProvider` to `main-designsystem.tsx` reusing the hook
- [x] Rebuild + sanity-check all three targets; regenerate `monologg-design-system.html`

### Phase 8 — Landing page visual rework
- [x] Read both user-supplied style-reference files (`saaswebskill.skill`, `saaswebskill2.skill`) in full
- [x] Synthesize a distinct visual system: borrow the *mechanics* (gradient atmosphere, hard-offset shadows, bento layout, mono eyebrows), not the literal colors/fonts of either reference
- [x] Add additive-only tokens to `tokens.css` (`--gradient-brand*`, `--shadow-cutout*`) — nothing existing changed value
- [x] Extend `Avatar.tsx` with an optional photo (`src`) prop, backward compatible
- [x] Rebuild `LandingPage.tsx`: hero mockup + gradient atmosphere, photo social-proof cluster, bento feature grid, 3D-style icon tiles, full-bleed photography section, real testimonial photos — all existing copy retained
- [x] Rebuild all three targets + regenerate `monologg-app.html`; open for user review

## 🔄 In Progress

- [ ] **Living-document discipline itself.** Ongoing habit, not a one-time task — every future change to the app should also move a checkbox here and add a line to `log.md`, in the same session.

---

## ⏳ Not started (backlog, roughly in unblocking order)

These are gaps against the original PRD, carried over from `design.md` §6. None of this has been started.

- [ ] **Backend/API layer** — zero server-side code exists today
- [ ] **Database / real data model** — mock constants per page are the closest thing to a schema
- [ ] **Real authentication** — no password check, session, JWT, or protected routes
- [ ] **Real payment/escrow integration** — PRD specifies FINCRA; currently a fake 2.5s delay
- [ ] **Real AI verification** — "Thespian AI" is a scripted animation, not a model call
- [ ] **Calendar sync** — Google Calendar "sync" button is UI-only
- [ ] **Notifications backend** — panel exists, data is hardcoded
- [ ] **Transaction history / help-support / terms screens** (PRD SYS-01–04) — mostly unbuilt
- [ ] **Type-scale token adoption** — `--font-size-*` tokens exist but most page headings still use ad-hoc pixel values
- [ ] **Font self-hosting** — currently loads General Sans / Plus Jakarta Sans / JetBrains Mono from Fontshare/Google Fonts CDNs; silently falls back to system fonts offline
- [ ] **Git initialization** — this folder is still not a version-controlled repository; recommended as the first step for whoever picks this up next

## How to use this file

- **Starting a task:** move its line from "Not started" to "In Progress," with a one-line note on who/when if useful.
- **Finishing a task:** move it to "Done," under the phase it belongs to (add a new phase heading if it doesn't fit an existing one).
- **New scope discovered:** add it to "Not started" rather than letting it live only in a conversation — if it's not here, the next person won't know about it.
- Always pair a checkbox move with a `log.md` entry (the "why/how") — this file only tracks the "what/status."
